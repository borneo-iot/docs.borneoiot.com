# MQTT protocol for the Cloud

Borneo-IoT supports secure remote communication with the server using the encrypted MQTT protocol, enabling users to control Borneo-IoT compatible devices at home or in the office from any location via the mobile app.

This feature is not included in the open-source project because it involves renting a cloud server for backend operations and must comply with data protection regulations in various countries.
