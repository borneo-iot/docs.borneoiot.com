# WiFi Provisioning

The purpose of WiFi provisioning is to provide the name(SSID) and password of a WiFi hotspot to "headless" devices, such as our WiFi LED lights, which lack input and display capabilities, allowing them to connect to a WiFi network.

This project uses the ESPTouch protocol provided by the Espressif ESP32 series for provisioning. please refer to the [ESP-IDF documentation](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp-touch_user_guide_en.pdf) for the details.
