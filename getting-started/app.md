# Mobile App

## Build from source

### Environment Setup

First, refer to the official Google Flutter documentation to set up the development environment, ensuring that the flutter command is added to the %PATH% or $PATH environment variable.

### Building and Running

Prepare a mobile emulator or connect a real device, navigate to the `client` directory, and for Android devices, execute:

```bash
flutter run
```

Since the app uses the Flutter cross-platform framework, it can also run on Windows and Linux, though it has not been adapted for landscape mode.

I do not own any Apple devices, so iOS support is theoretical and untested.
