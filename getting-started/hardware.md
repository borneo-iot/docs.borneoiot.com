# Hardware

The hardware design uses the open-source [Horizon EDA](https://horizon-eda.org). After installation, open the corresponding `.hprj` project file in the directory.

Note that the core board of this project requires a 1.27mm pitch 6-Pin programming clip, or you can also use an general ESP32-C3 development board.
