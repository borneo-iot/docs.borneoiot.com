# Hardware

The hardware design is created with the open-source Horizon EDA ([horizon-eda.org](https://horizon-eda.org)). After installing Horizon EDA, open the corresponding `.hprj` project file in this directory.

The Buce module in this project requires a 0.5" (1.27 mm) pitch 6-pin programming clip. Alternatively, you can use a general ESP32-C3 development board.

:::{note}
Using a third-party development board such as the [XIAO-ESP32C3](xiaoc3-hardware) is intended only for initial firmware testing. Except for Wiâ€‘Fi connectivity, LED dimming PWM outputs, and the fan PWM output, other features depend on the peripheral circuits on the custom PCB used in this project.
